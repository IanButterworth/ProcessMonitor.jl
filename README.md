# ProcessMonitor.jl

Measure resource use of a process in Julia — CPU utilization, memory (RSS), and thread
count — optionally including the subprocesses it spawns. Includes `top()`, an interactive
`htop`-like terminal view built on the same machinery.

Process information is read without spawning a subprocess: from `/proc` on Linux (so it
works in minimal containers) and via libproc syscalls on macOS (so it works under sandboxes
that forbid executing `ps`). The BSDs use `ps`, which is always in the base system.
Windows is not yet supported.

## Installation

```julia
pkg> add ProcessMonitor
```

## CPU utilization

CPU% is derived by differencing two samples of a process's cumulative CPU time, so it
always describes an *interval*, never an instant. `100%` means one CPU core was fully used
on average over the interval; a process using several cores can report more than `100%`.
(The `%cpu` column that `ps`/`top` report is deliberately avoided: it is a
platform-dependent decaying average — FreeBSD, for instance, often reports ~0.)

### Sampler (non-blocking, reusable)

Best for polling — e.g. a timer that prints utilization periodically. Each call reports the
usage since the previous call:

```julia
using ProcessMonitor

s = CPUSampler(getpid(); recursive=true)   # recursive: include subprocesses
# ... some work, or on each tick of a timer:
cpu_percent(s)   # => 96.3   (utilization since the last call)
```

### Blocking convenience

Starts an interval timer, records the baseline, waits for the timer, and samples again.
Starting the timer first keeps baseline collection from extending the requested period.
The interval must be finite and greater than zero:

```julia
cpu_percent(getpid(); recursive=true, interval=0.5)   # => 96.3
```

## Point-in-time reads

```julia
rss()                                # resident memory of this process, bytes
rss(pid; recursive=true)             # ... plus its live subprocesses
thread_count(pid)                    # OS threads in the process
cpu_time(pid)                        # cumulative CPU seconds so far
ProcessMonitor.info(pid; recursive=true)  # (; cpu_time, rss, threads, processes)
```

All functions also accept a `Base.Process`:

```julia
p = run(`some_program`, wait=false)
cpu_percent(p; interval=1.0)
rss(p; recursive=true)
```

## Interactive system view

```julia
julia> top()
```

An `htop`-like view with some things `htop` doesn't have:

- **Tree view sorted by subtree** (`T`): trees are ordered by their whole subtree's usage,
  so "sort by CPU" surfaces the busiest tree even when its root is an idle shell; `a`
  additionally rolls each subtree's CPU/RSS/threads up into its parent's row — the "who is
  really using the CPU" question flat per-process views can't answer.
- **Julia-aware**: Julia processes are highlighted and labeled with their version (from
  the juliaup/app install path; in-tree builds show `dev`), role (`worker`,
  `precompile`) and `--project`; a header rollup totals Julia's CPU, memory and threads
  across the machine; `j` filters to Julia processes only; and `P` asks a Julia process
  to print a one-shot profile to its stderr (`SIGUSR1`/`SIGINFO`). Handy for watching a
  test suite, `Distributed` workers, or precompilation fan-out.
- **Braille history graphs** for system CPU and memory, per-process CPU sparklines on wide
  terminals, a per-core mini-bar row, and user/sys split CPU bars.
- **Expanded signal view** (`g`): full-width, high-resolution Braille histories for total
  CPU and memory, with live/average/peak context and adaptive colored trails for individual
  cores.
- **Process age and state columns** — sort by newest (`s`) to catch spawn storms; zombies
  and uninterruptible-sleep processes are color-coded.
- **Detail pane** (`enter`): full command line, executable, start time, parent, fd count.
- **Honest memory accounting**: active+wired+compressed on macOS (what Activity Monitor
  reports), `MemAvailable`-based on Linux — not the misleading `total - free`.
- **Interval-accurate CPU%** from cumulative CPU-time differencing (the same portable
  method as the API), not a decaying average.

Keys (`?` shows this in-app): `g` expanded graphs · `c`/`m`/`t`/`p`/`n`/`s` sort ·
`T` tree · `a` Σ rollup ·
`j` julia-only · `C` command lines · `/` filter · `u` mine-only · `↑`/`↓` select ·
`enter` detail · `k`/`K` SIGTERM/SIGKILL (with confirmation) · `P` profile · `+`/`-`
interval · `space` pause · `q` quit.

Mouse-capable terminals, including iTerm2, can click the subtly underlined controls:
click a column heading to sort (again to reverse), the CPU/MEM summary to open expanded
graphs, or a footer action to invoke it. Click a process row to select it and double-click
to open its detail pane.

The process table starts with no selected row. Press `↓` to enter it; pressing `↑` from
the first row returns to the unselected position.

`top(io)` renders a single non-interactive frame to any `IO` (for logging or CI
diagnostics); use `tree=true` for the tree form or `graphs=true` for the signal view.

## Notes

- `recursive=true` walks the process tree at call time, so it covers subprocesses that are
  still alive; resources of already-exited children are not included.
- Recursive `rss` counts pages shared between the processes once per process, so it can
  overstate the combined footprint.
- On the BSDs `ps` reports CPU time with one-second resolution, so very short `cpu_percent`
  intervals quantize the result; prefer a couple of seconds or a longer polling period.
  Linux and macOS have finer resolution. Thread counts on the BSDs need a `ps` with `nlwp`.
